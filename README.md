This program is designed to demonstrate basic file handling operations such as creating, writing, reading, and appending data to a file. File handling is a fundamental aspect of many applications that need to store data permanently, and this program helps understand how to perform such tasks using standard C functions.

The program begins by including the necessary header files, stdio.h and stdlib.h, which provide access to essential input/output functions and utilities. Inside the main() function, a file pointer (FILE *fptr) is declared, which is used to open and interact with the file. The first operation in the program is to open the file in write mode using the fopen() function with the "w" mode. This either creates a new file or overwrites the existing one. 

Once the file is open, a predefined message is stored in a character array. This message briefly explains the purpose of fopen() and fclose() functions. The content is then written into the file using the fprintf() function, which allows formatted text to be written to a file. After the data is written, the file is closed using fclose(). This is important because it ensures all data is flushed from memory to the file and system resources are released.

After writing, the program moves on to reading from the same file. It reopens the file, this time in read mode ("r"), and again checks if the file was opened successfully. If the file is accessible, a loop is used to read each line from the file using the fgets() function. This function reads a line of text up to a specified number of characters and stores it in a buffer. The read content is then printed to the console using printf(). This allows the user to see the content that was previously written into the file.

To demonstrate appending functionality, the program opens the file again using "a" mode, which stands for append. In this mode, any data written is added to the end of the existing content without erasing anything. A new line of text is written to the file using fprintf(), and the file is closed afterward. This shows how additional data can be added without modifying or losing previous entries.

Finally, the program performs a second read operation to display the full contents of the file after the append. The same logic is used as in the earlier read part: open the file in read mode, read it line by line using fgets(), and print each line using printf(). This ensures the user can verify that both the original data and the appended line are present in the file.
Overall, this program is a complete example of basic file handling in C. It shows how to open, write to, read from, and append to a file using standard C functions.

*APPLICATION*: It can be used to create and maintain log files in software systems, save user inputs or configuration settings in desktop applications, or record data generated by sensors in embedded systems. It is especially useful for generating reports or saving analysis results in scientific and engineering applications. The ability to write, read, and append text allows it to act as the foundation for building more complex features like file-based databases, note-taking apps, backup systems, or text editors.

*EDITOR PLATFORM*: Visual Studio Code

*LIBRARY*: <stdio.h>,<stdlib.h>

*CONCEPTS*:  Use of basic file handling functions in C, such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgets(), and fclose(), to perform file operations like creating, writing, reading, and appending data and how different file modes ("w", "r", and "a") affect file behavior and data handling.
